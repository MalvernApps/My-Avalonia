# AvaloniaRibbon
Ribbon Control for Avalonia- my own view of it. Black and white icons can be eliminated.

The purpose of this Avalonia component is to replicate Microsoft's Ribbon UI, as seen in Windows 8+'s File Explorer, Microsoft Office 2007+, and in various other places, for Avalonia. In its present state, it is fairly usable, but some features are still missing, so it should not considered complete.

It is presently used in **[Jaya File Manager](https://github.com/JayaFM/Jaya)**, but other projects are welcome to use it.


# Avalonia Ribbon
Please acknowledge Splitwirez for all the last new features added to the ribbon. As far as I'm concerned, I'm just centralizing the code and updating the nuget.

You can also acknowledge Rubal Walia for cleaning up all my messy code.

This code will be very in-frequenclty updated if ever.
